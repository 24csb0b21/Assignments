            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>The Qutub Minar is a towering minaret located in the Qutub Complex in Mehrauli, Delhi, India. It stands at a height of 72.5 meters (237.8 feet) and was built by Qutb-ud-din Aibak in 1193. It is considered one of the tallest brick structures in the world.</p>

            <p>The minaret was constructed to celebrate the victory of Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the first ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, over the last Hindu kingdom in Delhi. The Qutub Minar is known for its intricate carvings and inscriptions in Arabic. It was originally designed as a tower for the call to prayer, and it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

            <p>The monumentâ€™s design features a combination of Afghan and Indian architectural styles. Over the centuries, parts of the minaret have been damaged by earthquakes, but it has been restored multiple times. Today, the Qutub Minar stands as a testament to the architectural brilliance of the medieval period in India.</p>
