        <h2>History of the Red Fort</h2>
        <p>The Red Fort, or Lal Qila, is a historic fort located in the city of Delhi, India. It was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty for around 200 years, until the British colonial era. The fort was commissioned by Emperor Shah Jahan in 1638 and completed in 1648, during the peak of Mughal architecture. The Red Fort is made of red sandstone, which gives it its name, and it stands as a symbol of Mughal power and grandeur.</p>
        <p>The fort's construction was a grand endeavor, and its design is a blend of Persian, Timurid, and Indian architecture. It houses several museums today and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. The Red Fort is also famous for its annual Independence Day celebrations, where the Prime Minister of India hoists the national flag and delivers a speech.</p>
